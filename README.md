# Regime-Adaptive Trend and Risk System

This project develops a systematic trading framework that adapts to changing market regimes by combining trend-following strategies, volatility modeling, and risk-based portfolio control across major commodities.

The system detects volatility regimes using econometric models and adjusts trend signals and position sizing dynamically.
